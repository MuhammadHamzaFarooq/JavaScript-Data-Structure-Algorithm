# Map

#### A map is an unordered Collection of key-value pairs. Both keys and values can be of any data types. To retrieve a value, you can use the corresponding key. Maps are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop

## Object Vs Map

#### Objects are unordered whereas maps are ordered. keys in objects can only be string or symbol type whereas in maps, they can be of any type. An Object has a prototype and may contain a few default keys which may collide with your own keys if you're not careful. A map on the other hands does not contain any keys by default. Object are not iterables where as maps are iterables. The number of items in an objects must be determined manually where as it is readily available with the size property in a map. Apart from storing data, you can attach functionality to an object whereas maps are restricted to just storing data.

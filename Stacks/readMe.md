# Stack

##### The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). The last element inserted into the stack is the first elements to be removed. A stack of plates. The last plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate removed from the stack. Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by it behavior rather than being a mathematical model. The Stack data structure supports two main operations.

- Push, which adds an elements to the collection.
- Pop, which removes the most recently added elements form the collection.

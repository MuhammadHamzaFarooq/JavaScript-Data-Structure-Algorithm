# Arrays

#### An array is a data structures that can hold a collection of values. Arrays can contain a mix of different data types. You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same array. An Array are resizable. You don't have to declare the size of an array before creating it. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed and the insertion order is maintained. Arrays are iterables. They can be used with a for loop.

## Arrays - Big-O Time Complexity

- insert / remove form end - O(1)
- insert / remove form beginning - O(n)
- Access - O(1)
- Search - O(n)
- Push / Pop - O(1)
- Shift / unshift / concat / slice / splice - O(n)
- forEach / map / filter / reduce - O(n)

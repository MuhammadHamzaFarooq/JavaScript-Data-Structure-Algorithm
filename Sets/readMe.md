# Sets

#### A set is a data structure that can hold a collection of values. The values however must be unique. Set can contain a mix of different data types. You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same set. Set are dynamically sized. You don't have to declare the size of a set before creating it. Sets do not maintain an insertion order.Set are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop

## Set vs Array

#### Array can contain duplicate values whereas Sets cannot insertion order is maintained in arrays but it is not the case with sets Searching and deleting an elements in the set is faster compared to arrays.
